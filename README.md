# UsbWatcher

This is a tool to monitor USB devices being inserted or removed.  
Because this is a project intended for personal learning, and because the features required to get the desired functionality grew rapidly, this project is currently fairly ugly and poorly optimised.  
  
  
NOTE: If you try to build this and use it, beware that there are some accessible features that do not fully work yet. The add dialogue is enabled in order to make sure the device ID detection is working, but adding devices manually is not implemented.  
It also only detects a limited number of device types at the moment, and the ID reading and detection is very naive and needs a lot of work.
